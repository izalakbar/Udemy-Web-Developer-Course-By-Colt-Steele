Filter Exercise
Let's get some practice using the filter method. Write a function called validUserNames that accepts an array of usernames (strings).  It should return a new array, containing only the usernames that are less than 10 characters. For example:

validUserNames(['mark', 'staceysmom1978', 'q29832128238983', 'carrie98', 'MoanaFan']);
// => ["mark", "carrie98", "MoanaFan"]


Note: The syntax for this solution might be a little strange to you at this point in the course because it requires you to write the code, that you just learned in the previous lecture, inside of a function. e.g.,

function validUserNames(usernames) {
  // your code here
}


or if you want to get fancy with an arrow function:

const validUserNames = usernames => // your code here;


There is no need to define an actual array of usernames, that part is done for you behind the scenes.
If you get stuck on this exercise, please see here for a quick video walkthrough.

SOLUTION #1:

function validUserNames(arr) {
  const filteredArr = arr.filter(function (name) {
    return name.length < 10;
  });
  return filteredArr;
}
SOLUTION #2:

function validUserNames(arr) {
  return arr.filter(name => name.length < 10);
}
SOLUTION #3:

// Concise full arrow function syntax approach:
const validUserNames = usernames => usernames.filter(usr => usr.length < 10);
