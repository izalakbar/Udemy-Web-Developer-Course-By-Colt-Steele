Arrow Function Exercise
Write an arrow function expression called greet.  It should accept a single string argument, representing a person's name.  It should return a greeting string as shown below:

greet("Hagrid") //"Hey Hagrid!" 
greet("Luna") //"Hey Luna!"
Be sure to use arrow function syntax!

SOLUTION #1:

const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hey ${name}!`;
}
SOLUTION #2:

// More concise approach:
const greet = name => `Hey ${name}!`;
