Function Expression Exercise
Define a function that returns the square of a number. Define the function as a function expression, stored in a variable called square.  NOTE: Udemy's coding exercise platform does NOT support the ** operator. 

square(4) //16
square(3) //9

//Answer
const square = function(number) {
  return number * number;
};

// Test the function
console.log(square(4)); // Output: 16
console.log(square(3)); // Output: 9
